more info: [YT - DNS Server at home - Christian Lempa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syzwLwE3Xq4&ab_channel=ChristianLempa)

## Why? 

I want to have a DNS server in my homelab to resolve servers / machines / docker containers and would like to extend on this to have valid SSL certificates on my homelab services. 

## Why BIND9? 

It is a very versatile, enterprise level and open-source DNS server.

## Requirements

To run the BIND9 docker container we need: 
1. A VM with Ubuntu Server 22.04
2. Docker and Docker compose installed
